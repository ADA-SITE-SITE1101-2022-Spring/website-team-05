        <p class="event__description">We are team 5- Afsana, Susan, Emin, and Gunel. To begin with, we created a WhatsApp group. However, we found Gunel’s number after spending enough time looking for it. We decided to arrange a small meeting between us to discuss what to do during event. We gathered at B building but there was just Afsana, Susan, and Emin. In a small amount of time, we succeed to divide our whole work into small parts according to our skills and interests for the event. 
            Firstly, Susan found the school with a great effort because all schools we called asked for special permission from Ministry of Education. To make sure, Susan called Ministry of Education and asked questions about this special permission, and they informed that it would take a month to get it. Eventually, we, as a team decided to go № 176 school which is located in Yasamal, Baku.
            After last preparations, on 17th March of 2022 we went to the school. Director of the school was so sincere and welcoming. He greeted us very friendly and respectfully. He gave the direction to the school staff to took care of us accurately and to provide us with everything we need. Actually, we had decided to hold the event with 8th grades but after having a small talk with staff of the school, we decided to do it with 6th grades because in that way we would get a chance to influence younger children before they have chosen their future path. 6th grades became very happy and welcoming to see us. Also, we wanted to hold the event at the computer room, but the class was small and not appropriate for carrying 20 and more people. Therefore, the most suitable one was ordinary classroom of 6th grades. 
            We would lie if we said all went smoothly. We had connection and projector problems because at school there was no smartboard and proper internet connection. However, that was something that we expected because we all come from same type of schools. So, Emin helped a lot to provide our computers with fast internet connection with her mobile hotspot. The problem was not only internet but also projector. Our computers were not able to connect with projector, but the head of the class was so generous that she provided us with her computer to project our slides to the board. Overall, we fixed problems and started our event.
            Emin presented ADA university’s SITE slide with a great enthusiasm and there was no doubt that he had prepared very attentively and freestyle that he could grab children’s attention. He touched the main points such as admission requirements, education both in ADA and abroad, scholarship opportunities, student life and SITE majors. Children were so excited about our latest event-bahar youth festival that we could not keep the silence while talking about it. We almost presented 10 minutes about ADA. All in all, it was really nice to see the enthusiasm and interest on the children’s face. 
            Susan’s duty was introducing code.org and make the environment harmonized. She gained attention with showing famous people who is collaborated with code.org, making sarcastic jokes and rhetoric questions to the children. While Afsana and Emin were talking, Susan was creating interaction between them and children with the help of questions and examples. Thanks a lot, to Susan, it was not like a presentation, it was like a mutual conversation. If we must admit a minus of Susan’s role, sometimes she overused jokes just like in classes but at the end of the day it was not overwhelming.
            Afsana was responsible for tutoring of the course’s levels, but she explained all the details that was not clear for the children besides the course. Firstly, she informed the children about the general programming languages. Then she started to explain what the main purpose of the game “Angry Birds” is and the level of the course from the basic level till hardest one. Also, she showed that it is very natural to make mistakes at the levels because there is always a chance to start again. Lastly, she showed the kids the codes of each level they discussed.
            During the presentation, several older children also joined us to participate in our event because the head of the class introduced us entire school, so it was interesting to other classes. Unfortunately, everyone who wanted to come was not able to participate because of the lack of seats. In addition, one of the memorable parts of the day was the brief speech of the principal teacher, Farida khanum. She asked our SEC scores in front of the children to motivate them to work harder. She gave a very beautiful and motivational speech to both children and us that we were proud of ourselves to come there and do the event. She encouraged every student to reach their goals like us. She mentioned about the support from the government for students who are willing to gain academic success. 
             At the end of the event, several girls approached us and asked personal questions that can motivate them. They gave us number to contact with them and we accepted happily. We are always ready to answer questions that can lead even one of them to small.
            During event every member of our group was active about filming. Afsana took care of both filming/editing video. She posted in her personal Facebook account.
            That day we visited the school, we realized how small we do, how great the children influence. It is a great opportunity to meet people who approach you at young ages warmly and try to make a difference in the world. Thanks to you, Araz müəllim, you gave us this chance to be a member of these people. 
            All things considered, we all worked as a team, everyone did very good job. To tell the truth, we had not divided our duties very sharply, we felt free to help and share our opinions. But the  most important we did not forget to have fun.</p>
