        <p class="members__description">We are first-year students of SITE at ADA University. Our team number is 5. Our website's name is "İndiki Gənclər". We have chosen it because we are actually "indiki gənclər". Even though most the people telling that the new generation, I mean, us is not good and old-times-youngs are better it is not true( can be some expectations). Coming the slogan, is " Yandır-söndür Düzələcək". That is a classic sentence when something is wrong with our technological types of equipment. We learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create our website. It was great to participate in such assignments together. We divided tasks fairly among ourselves, and each of us successfully completed the tasks assigned to us.</p>
